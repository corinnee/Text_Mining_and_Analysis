# Twitter Scraping and Thematic Analysis Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains the code and associated files for a Twitter scraping and thematic analysis assessment for the Year in Data Analytics programme at UKC. The assessment involves the analysis of Twitter data from two British Members of Parliament (MPs), Stephen Morgan and Royston Smith. The primary objectives of this assessment were to scrape tweets from both MPs, clean and preprocess the data, perform thematic analysis, and visualize the findings.

## Contents

1. **Code Files:**
   - `twitter_scraping.Rmd`: R Markdown document containing the code for data scraping, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
   
2. **Data Files:**
   - `SMorganMP.csv`: Excel file containing scraped tweets from Stephen Morgan.
   - `RSmithMP.csv`: Excel file containing scraped tweets from Royston Smith.

3. **Results and Discussion:**
   - `Twitter_Web_Scraping_Writeup.pdf`: PDF document containing the results, discussion, and insights derived from the analysis.

## Project Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow, which includes the following key steps:

- Data scraping: Tweets from both MPs (Stephen Morgan and Royston Smith) were scraped from Twitter, focusing on the most recent 3200 tweets.

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: The scraped data was cleaned to remove metadata, special characters, and irrelevant information.

- Thematic analysis: Thematic analysis was performed to identify and categorize recurring topics in the tweets of both MPs.

- Visualization: Various visualizations, including word clouds and topic proportions, were created to present the findings in an accessible format.

## Key Insights

The assessment provides valuable insights into the Twitter usage and thematic preferences of MPs Stephen Morgan and Royston Smith. Notable findings include differences in their engagement with COVID-19-related topics, the prominence of local issues in their tweets, and their distinctive thematic focuses.
